Q2: 2.27.1
Q3: 2.31.0
Q4: They are different versions. The virtual environment contains a newer version
Q5: It returns a 301 Moved Permanently code. To get a 200 code, we must visit http://www.google.com
Q6: http://google.com/teapot returns a 301 code with curl -i. 
    With curl -iL, it requests the redirect as well and the code for that request is 418 I'm a teapot.
    This is the status code returned by http://www.google.com/teapot
Q7: Fields indicating the request type show that the request using curl -i -X post -d "X=Y" was a POST request.
    Simply using curl -i sends a GET request. -X POST is useful if we want to send a POST request.
